Once upon a time, lived a man named Carl, who was an aspiring computer scienitst.
He was still just a normal student in a fairly well known university, until 'it'
happened and his life turned into complete catastrophe.

So what was "it"? Was it a car accident? Was it a shutting down of the university?
 Are Carl's parents unable to afford the tuition payments? No. None of these.
 So what exactly happened?

"It" was something that he created in a university lab. This thing wasn't a
 chemical, or a novel material, it was a creature. A creature with horns and
 rows and rows of grinding teeth. But worst of all, powerful back legs that gave
 it the power to leap after its prey like a frog. Luckily, the creature was only
 the size of a cat.

Fortunately for Carl, as the creature was only the size of a cat, he could stuff it in his backpack
and figure out what to do with it at home, removing any evidence any anything suspicious from the
lab. He biked back to his apartment, unlocked the door, and furiously opened up the backpack.
However, 'it' was nowhere to be seen.

At that moment, billion possibilities flied through his head, and every single
outcome led to him being questioned by the FBI. He had to get 'it' back. When he went
back outside to find 'it', the problem was not finding it, but rather it was too easy
to find it. The cat sized creature now had grown taller than a 5 story building. It 
was devouring anything from cats, humans, cars to concrete buildings. Seeing this with 
his own two eyes, he was fascinated that what he created could bring such chaos in 
the world. Since he knew he couldn't regain control of 'it' anymore, and he now will 
be questioned by the FBI and jailed for life, this is how Carl, the aspiring Computer 
Scientist, began his new catastrophic life of a fugitive and later a criminal mastermind.
