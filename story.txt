Once upon a time, lived a man named Carl, who was an aspiring computer scienitst.
He was still just a normal student in a fairly well known university, until 'it'
happened and his life turned into complete catastrophe.

So what is "it"? Is it a car accident? Is it the shutting down of the university? Are Carl's parents unable to afford the tuition payments? No. None of these. So what exactly happened?

"It" was something that he created in a university lab. This thing wasn't a chemical, or a novel material, it was a creature. A creature with horns and rows and rows of grinding teeth. But worst of all, powerful back legs that gave it the power to leap after its prey like a frog. Luckily, the creature was only the size of a cat.
