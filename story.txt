Once upon a time, lived a man named Carl, who was an aspiring computer scienitst.
He was still just a normal student in a fairly well known university, until 'it'
happened and his life turned into complete catastrophe.

So what is "it"? Is it a car accident? Is it the shutting down of the university? Are Carl's parents unable to afford the tuition payments? No. None of these. So what exactly happened?
